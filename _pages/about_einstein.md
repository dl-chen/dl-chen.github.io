Hello there! I'm a dedicated professional with nearly five years of experience in the world of cloud support engineering. I've got a knack for understanding client needs and turning them into effective IT solutions. I'm adaptable, detail-oriented, and thrive in team settings. My experience includes leading multiple successful projects and I'm proud to have been recognized as one of the top case closers in North America. I'm passionate about leveraging my skills in collaboration and leadership to make a positive impact in the technology field.

Outside of work, my biggest passion in life currently is rock climbing. There is something so gratifying, yet humbling about the sport that keeps me motivated to keep coming back and conquering new challenges. As of now, most of my time is spent in indoor gyms, but I have just started my journey in outdoor climbing and I hope to make it a lifelong one. If you want to learn more about my other interests, please see my hobbies page.
